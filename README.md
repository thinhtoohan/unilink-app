# UniLink

## About

Many college students feel isolated or struggle to find study partners and mentors who truly understand their academic journey. Often, they face challenges in finding peers with similar academic backgrounds, language preferences, or cultural experiences. While traditional social media platforms exist, they lack the support needed for meaningful connections in an academic context.

UniLink solves this issue by allowing students to create personalized profiles based on their academic year, major, and home country. This targeted approach helps students find peers who share similar educational paths and cultural backgrounds, creating more relevant and productive interactions. UniLink bridges the gap by fostering a supportive community where students can find their tribe.
